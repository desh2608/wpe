# Nara-WPE in CuPy

This package is modified from the core parts of [nara_wpe](https://github.com/fgnt/nara_wpe) 
and modifies it to use [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for accelerated GPU-based inference.

At the moment, it is meant to be used with the [GSS](https://github.com/desh2608/gss) toolkit.
